# Matrix teminal wallpaper?

A silly matrix scrolling terminal wallpaper thing.
It runs smoothly in a very small terminal. VERY small.

For anyone interested in improving:
- double buffer the chars and then flush to terminal in one go
- port to linux (main function contains getting term width/height)

## Running

Simply run `odin run .`.
